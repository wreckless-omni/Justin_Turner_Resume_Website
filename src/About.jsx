    </header>
    <p>
    I am a recent graduate with a B.A.S. in software development.<br/>
I come from an audio background with a decade of experience <br/>
in professional audio and recording.

I believe in doing creative things <br/>
within a solid collaborative framework. <br/>
My mission is to do great work and contribute as part of a team<br/>
while simultaneously learning to further my skills as an individual developer.<br/>

If it doesn't work, all of it is meaningless.<br/>
I want to make it work.<br/>
I want to help build the digital future.<br/>
